## Scraper with LLM and streamlit

This is a demo project to show how to create a modern day (LLM aided) scraper using Beautiful Soup
and Gemini/Gemma to scrape (almost) any website.

For the example, it will scrape talk titles and speakers from 15+ GDG DevFests around the world.

### This is how it looks

It has multiple steps:

#### Step 1 - Beautiful Soup scraper output
